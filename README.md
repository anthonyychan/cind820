**Description of Project:**

This capstone project will dive into the variables that take place in every NBA basketball game and use machine learning techniques to determine which variables impact a team's chances of winning each game.

The dataset used for this project is composed of statistics of NBA players and teams from the years, 2014 - 2018. Many factors can go into winning a championship in the NBA, for example the 3-Point Field Goal Percentage, Field Goal Percentage, Free Throw Percentage, Turnovers, Offensive and Defensive Rebounds, and many more statistics.

Tentative Stages of Project:

The first step of this project was to come up with an abstract to outline the project and the questions we will answer throughout this capstone project. This included the problem statement, desired tools to be used, dataset choice, and general ideaology of the project. Then, we had  to conduct a literature review to help get more information regarding this topic and how these can help develop the project. We would get these from research papers and articles on the internet where they have studied multiple datasets and used different machine learning techniques to determine their outputs. Initial results and code were submitted to check validity of code and get a sense of what we will see in our final results and conclusion statements.
