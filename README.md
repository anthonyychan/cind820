**Description of Project:**

This capstone project will dive into the variables that take place in every NBA basketball game and use machine learning techniques to determine which variables impact a team's chances of winning each game.

The dataset used for this project is composed of statistics of NBA players and teams from the years, 2014 - 2018. Many factors can go into winning a championship in the NBA, for example the 3-Point Field Goal Percentage, Field Goal Percentage, Free Throw Percentage, Turnovers, Offensive and Defensive Rebounds, and many more statistics.
